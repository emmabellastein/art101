					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this assignment was thinking of individual steps of a simple game that you don't normally think about the rules of. I also had a hard time inserting the outline image; that seems to be my biggest struggle in HTML. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My main problem was inserting the image of my outline, as mentioned above. I struggled with images on the past lab as well, so when writing the code didn't work, I compared it with my successful image links from the previous assignments. I couldn't find any major differences, but I was able to get the image to work after using VS Code's "Copy Path" feature to copy and paste a link to the image. This makes me think my problem was in my labelling of the image itself, since all I changed was the image tag, not the rest of the code. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment really helped me understand the individual steps that go into the things I do in every day life, and how that translates to programming. Working on the lab page has helped me realize how comfortable I am getting with basic HTML and CSS, and even though it's mostly formatting I feel very comfortable with, it feels like good progress for me. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> We worked together to psuedocode a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and then we individually translated that psuedocode into JavaScript comments. I also formatted new sections in the HTML, added an image, and formatted the CSS. My partner and I worked together to come up with ideas for psuedocoding, and putting those comments into Java and then HTML. </p>
