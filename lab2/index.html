			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p> Hi, I’m Emmabella, I’m a 3rd year majoring in Film & Digital Media as well as Psychology. I don’t have any coding experience, but I am interested in digital media and art so I wanted to learn. I am also interested in writing, design (set, character, interior, you name it), terrible early 2000s movies (Clueless is my favorite), baking, camping and snowboarding. </p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My main challenge was that I thought we were working with the same partners from Lab1 until it was too late to find a new one, and it was more time sensical to work alone. This made me realize how vague my understanding of HTML and CSS is, and how much practice I need to make a functional website. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The power outage on Thursday posed a bit of a problem for this assignment, as we didn't learn CSS until the afternoon before the assignment was due. This was a simple fix, as I just focused entirely on HTML until Tuesday evening. I was also having problems with linking my CSS with my HTML. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> While working alone made this project a bit more difficult and time consuming, it helped me further understand HTML and how to use my resources to answer my questions when I can't rely on other people. </p>
